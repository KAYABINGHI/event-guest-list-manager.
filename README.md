# EVENT GUEST LIST MANAGER

## Description

The Event Guest List Manager is a simple web application built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to manage a guest list for an event by adding, removing, and updating guest information dynamically without refreshing the browser. This project focuses on practicing DOM manipulation, form handling, and user input processing in a deliverable-driven code challenge.


## Features

- Add a guest's name to the list via an input form.
- Display the guest list on the page after submission.
- Remove a guest from the list using a "Remove" button.
- Toggle a guest’s RSVP status between "Attending" and "Not Attending".
- Limit the guest list to 10 people, with an alert if the limit is exceeded.


## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/KAYABINGHI/event-guest-list-manager.git

```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd event-guest-list-manager
```


3. Open index.html in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) to run the application locally. No additional dependencies or build tools are required.


## Usage
1. Open index.html in your browser.
2. Enter a guest’s name in the input field and click the "Submit" button to add them to the list.
3. Use the "Remove" button next to a guest’s name to delete them from the list.
4. Toggle the RSVP status of a guest between "Attending" and "Not Attending".
5. If the guest list exceeds 10 people, an alert will notify you.



## Developement
- JavaScript Logic: All DOM manipulation and event handling is implemented in src/index.js.

- Styling: Customize the look and feel in style.css. Be creative with your design!

- Testing: Manually test the application in the browser. Use console.log() to debug and reload the page to see updates.
## Deliverables
The application meets the following user requirements:





- Input a guest’s name and submit it to add to the list.



- Display the guest list on the page.



- Remove guests using a "Remove" button.



- Toggle RSVP status for each guest.



- Enforce a 10-guest limit with an alert.
